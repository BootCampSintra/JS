## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/BootCampSintra/JS/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
    </head>
    <body>
        <script>
var data={
  nome:prompt("Entre com seu nome :"),

}
console.log(data.nome);

        </script>
    </body>
</html>




For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/BootCampSintra/JS/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
